## Project Title  
*FixHub: Maintenance Request Tracking System*  

## Course and Section  
BSIT2-03 — Year 2025  

## Description  
FixHub is a project designed to make school maintenance simple, clear, and efficient. Currently, many maintenance requests are handled through emails, calls, or paperwork, which often leads to delays, miscommunication, and even forgotten tasks. This results in frustration for both staff and students, and it affects the overall learning environment.  

With FixHub, the process becomes more organized and transparent. Anyone in the school can easily submit a request, while the maintenance team can track, prioritize, and resolve issues effectively. Real-time updates keep everyone informed, and reporting tools provide insights that help schools plan for recurring or seasonal concerns.  

By streamlining maintenance operations, FixHub strengthens communication, reduces wasted time, and supports a safer and more efficient school environment. It focuses on what schools really need — quick reporting, clear workflows, and reliable tracking — without unnecessary complexity.
